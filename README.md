# Edge-Detection-and-Parallel-Processing-over-GPUs

# Performance Benchmark Test for GPUs vs CPUs

/******************Strategy and Algorithm*********************/

This project focuses on the scalable computational difference between the
sequential processing by the CPU and massive parallelization on the GPU as 
well as CPU. To use GPU infrastructure, consisting mainly of OpenCL and for
CPUs OpenMP thread implementation. This is achieved by execution of the 
same program on different resources.
Edge Detection is very high computing algorithms so we used this.


Libraries:  OpenCL
			OpenMP
